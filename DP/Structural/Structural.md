# Structural Design Patterns

### What are they?
Structural patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into **larger structures** while keeping these structures flexible and efficient. They focus on how classes inherit from each other and how they are composed.

### Why use them?
They ensure that if one part of a system changes, the entire structure doesn't need to be rebuilt.
* **Simplification:** They provide easier ways to use complex sub-systems (e.g., Facade).
* **Compatibility:** They help disparate interfaces work together (e.g., Adapter).
* **Resource Optimization:** They reduce memory footprint by sharing states (e.g., Flyweight) or controlling access (e.g., Proxy).
