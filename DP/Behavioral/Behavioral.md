# Behavioral Design Patterns

### What are they?
Behavioral patterns are concerned with **algorithms** and the **assignment of responsibilities** between objects.

### Why use them?
They don't just describe how objects are structured, but specifically how they **communicate**.
* They reduce complex control flows (like massive `if/else` or `switch` blocks).
* They allow objects to remain loosely coupled while still working together to perform a complex task.
* They move "how" a task is done into specific objects, making the logic interchangeable at runtime.
